# GDPS Hub

Preview private servers on GDPS Hub and play levels, or just take a look at what a server has to offer. If you have the GDPS Switcher mod enabled, you can save mods to it.

## Notes/Known Issues

- Levels save to the save file - This is an issue i have not been able to fix so far.
- Some descriptions may not render due to unsupported characters, such as cyrillic characters (can not fix)
- You can't rate or comment on levels - While previewing servers, you're basically viewing without an account.
- Completions will not save - This is intentional, although in the future it may be changed.
- If daily, weekly, or event levels don't load, the server may not have them set.
- Servers not supporting 2.2 may not work.
