# GDPS Hub

Preview private servers from GDPS Hub.

If you have GDPS Switcher installed, you can save a server to it.

## Notes/Known Issues

- Some descriptions may not render due to unsupported characters, such as cyrillic characters (can not fix)
- You can't rate or comment on levels - since you're technically on an account from another server.
- Completions will not save - This is intentional, although in the future it may be changed.
- If daily, weekly, or event levels don't load, the server may not have them set.
